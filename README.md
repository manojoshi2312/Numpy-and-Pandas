Data Analysis using NumPy and Pandas

This project focuses on data analysis using Python’s NumPy and Pandas libraries. It demonstrates key concepts in array and data manipulation through practical exercises, including temperature analysis, student marks evaluation, and transaction data exploration.

📂 Project Overview

NumPy Operations

Create and manipulate 1D & 2D arrays

Perform numerical computations (mean, max, min, Fahrenheit conversion)

Use slicing and indexing to extract specific data

Pandas Series

Create and modify Series with custom indices

Use loc/iloc for indexing and filtering

Apply boolean masks and compute derived metrics (e.g., CGPA)

Pandas DataFrame

Build a transaction dataset

Explore and summarize data using filtering, grouping, and aggregation

Modify, add, and remove data within the DataFrame

🛠️ Technologies Used
